    title: 'Adopting a Tree',
    text: `Consider adopting a tree near you!! To adopt, login on the main menu, select a tree on the map, and check the adopt checkbox in the tree info window. Once you adopt a tree, you will get watering notifications for the tree when the weather is hot. It will be easiest to do watering if you live closer than one block away from this tree. Thank you for helping us keep our trees healthy!`,

    title: 'Watering',
    text: `Proper watering is vital for a new street tree's health. In the initial years, maintain consistent moisture levels around the root zone. Water your tree deeply, providing around 10-15 gallons of water per inch of trunk diameter weekly, ensuring the soil remains moist but not waterlogged. During hot, dry weather, water twice a week. Use a drip irrigation system or soaker hose to achieve the desired moisture levels without causing erosion or runoff.`,

    title: 'Mulching',
    text: `Mulching helps maintain soil moisture, regulate soil temperature, and suppress weed growth. Apply a 2-4 inch layer of organic mulch, such as wood chips or shredded bark, in a circle around the tree, extending to the drip line. Avoid piling mulch against the trunk, as this can encourage disease and pests. Check the mulch annually, and replenish as needed to maintain the proper depth for optimal tree health.`,

    title: 'Weeding',
    text: `Weeds compete with young trees for water, nutrients, and sunlight. Regularly inspect the area around the tree and remove weeds by hand or with a hoe. Be cautious not to damage the tree's roots while weeding. To minimize weed growth, apply a layer of mulch around the tree, leaving a gap of a few inches between the mulch and the trunk to prevent rot and pest infestations.`,

    title: 'Staking',
    text: `Staking provides support for young street trees, particularly in windy areas or when the trunk is not strong enough to support the canopy. Use soft, flexible ties and sturdy stakes, placing them at least 18 inches away from the tree trunk. Attach the ties loosely enough to allow some trunk movement, promoting strong root development. Regularly inspect the ties and stakes for damage, adjusting them as necessary. Remove the stakes after one or two growing seasons.`,

    title: 'Pruning',
    text: `Pruning street trees promotes a strong structure, improves aesthetics, and removes dead, damaged, or diseased branches. Begin by pruning young trees during their dormant periods to establish a strong central leader and well-spaced lateral branches. As the tree matures, focus on removing crossing or rubbing branches, low-hanging limbs, and any branches that obstruct visibility or pedestrian access. Use clean, sharp tools, and follow proper pruning techniques to avoid causing unnecessary stress or damage. Many cities require city approval or a permit to prune street trees.`,

    title: 'Bracing',
    text: `Bracing provides essential support for new trees during heavy winds and storms. Install braces by attaching metal rods or cables between the branches that need additional support. Bracing should be installed with the help of a professional arborist or a trained tree planting group to ensure proper placement and tension. Inspect the braces annually for signs of wear, and ask your tree planting group or city to remove them once the tree has developed sufficient strength to support its canopy.`,
